# Default Avatar Placeholder

This directory should contain a default-avatar.jpg file for the default user avatar.

For now, a placeholder will be created by the FileStorageService if the actual image file is not present.

You can replace this with an actual default avatar image by:
1. Adding a default-avatar.jpg file to this directory
2. The image should be approximately 100x100 pixels
3. Supported formats: JPG, PNG

The FileStorageService will automatically use this image as the default avatar for users who haven't uploaded their own avatar.
